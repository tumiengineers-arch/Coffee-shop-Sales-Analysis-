   **Coffee Shop Sales Analysis** 

The CEO wants actionable insights from historical sales data of Bright Coffee Shop to guide revenue growth and product performance.

my role will be to:

Ingest & Organize Data: Load the sales dataset into Snowflake for structured analysis.

Database Setup:

* Create a database called sales

* Create a schema called retail

* Create a table called bright_coffee to store the data.

Data Processing:

Clean and transform data (e.g., fix price formats, calculate total_amount = unit_price * transaction_qty, create time buckets).

Use SQL queries to analyze performance by product, time of day, and trends.

Analysis & Visualization:

Export results to Excel

Build pivot tables and charts for:

Revenue by product

Peak sales times -----> So this one  i will use Day classification

Best- and worst-performing products -----> This one we can limit to maybe 5 products<br>
